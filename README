The Free Whitespace Interpreter
===============================

This program is (as far as I know) a fully-compliant interpreter for the
esoteric programming language known as Whitespace.  A description of Whitespace
can be viewed here:

Dependencies
============
The only dependencies are a C++ compiler and the GNU multiple precision library
(GMP).
